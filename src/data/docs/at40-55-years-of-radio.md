[**American TOP 40**](/intellirdb?v=charts&sv=at40)

AT40 is a legendary syndicated radio program that has been counting down America's most popular songs for over five decades. Celebrating its 55th anniversary on July 4, 2025, AT40 remains one of the most influential and enduring programs in radio history.

### Origins and Historic Debut

This radio program was created by Casey Kasem, Don Bustany, Tom Rounds, and Ron Jacobs. AT40 first aired on the US Independence Day weekend in 1970, on seven radio stations, the first being KDEO in El Cajon, California (now KECR), which broadcast the inaugural show the evening of July 3, 1970. The program was inspired by Make Believe Ballroom, a nationally syndicated radio show from the 1940s that popularized the disc jockey format.

The chart data broadcast for the premiere show actually included the top 40 songs from the week ending July 11, 1970. The first show featured the last time both Elvis Presley and the Beatles had songs simultaneously in the Top 10. This historic debut marked the beginning of what would become a cultural phenomenon that documented America's musical tastes for generations.

The first Number One song was "Mama Told Me Not to Come" by Three Dog Night. Kasem's vision was to create a weekly countdown show that combined chart information with human stories, setting it apart from simple music programming.

### Rapid Global Expansion

The show's rapid expansion was remarkable. By the early 1980s, the show could be heard on 520 stations in the United States and at its zenith, the show was broadcast on 1,000-plus stations in some 50 countries. This global reach established AT40 as not just an American institution, but an international cultural export.

### Format Evolution and Technical Distribution

AT40 presents the top 40 songs in descending order, building suspense toward the number one hit. Initially conceived as a three-hour program, AT40 expanded to a four-hour-program on October 7, 1978, to reflect the increasing average length of singles on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. The show's format combined chart countdown with storytelling, creating a unique blend of music and narrative that kept listeners engaged throughout its extended runtime.

During AT40's first year, the show was sent to radio stations on reel-to-reel tapes. After the first year, AT40 was recorded on vinyl, with one side of a 33 1/3 rpm LP holding a half hour's worth of show content, requiring four records for each four-hour show.

The program became famous for its "Long Distance Dedications" segment, where listeners could request songs for loved ones far away. This feature evolved organically when staffer Matt Wilson found such a letter while checking the show's mail in August 1978. The listener asked Kasem to play the song "Desiree" by Neil Diamond, which he dedicated to his girlfriend of the same name who was moving to West Germany to live with her family on an Army base. The request was fulfilled on August 26, 1978, launching one of radio's most beloved segments.

### Casey Kasem (1970-1988, 1998-2004)

Casey Kasem hosted [the original run from July 4, 1970](/intellirdb?v=assets&sv=docs&dv=at40-premiere-broadcast), through August 6, 1988. By the early 1980s, the show was heard on more than 500 stations across America and on the Armed Forces Radio Network around the world. Kasem's warm, conversational style and human interest stories between songs became the show's defining characteristic.

Kasem's tenure established many of the show's most beloved features. His warm, conversational style and philosophical approach to broadcasting made him a household name. Kasem told the New York Times in 1990 "I accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. That is the timeless thing."

Kasem's closing became legendary in broadcasting. After the number-one song was played, the bumper music began playing, and over that, Kasem typically reported that week's chart date and read the end credits, then signed off with what became his, and the show's, unofficial motto: "Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."


After a contract dispute, Kasem was replaced by Shadoe Stevens. Industry trade paper Billboard magazine reported that the main disputes between Kasem and Watermark/ABC were over his salary (which Westwood One tripled upon his signing), because of declining ratings and a smaller group of stations airing the show. Many AT40 listeners were upset by Kasem's departure, and Kasem joined the Westwood One radio network less than a year later to start a rival show, Casey's Top 40.

Kasem returned to host AT40 from 1998 to 2004, bridging the gap between the classic era and the modern digital age. Kasem's final No. 1 was Outkast's "Hey Ya!", which hit the top of the chart on the weekend of December 13, 2003.


### Shadoe Stevens (1988-1995)

Shadoe Stevens' first American Top 40 show aired on August 13, 1988, on 1,014 stations. During Stevens' era, AT40 switched from Billboard to other charts like Hot 100 Airplay and Mainstream Top 40. Stevens brought a more contemporary, energetic style to the program, though many longtime fans preferred Kasem's approach.

Stevens attempted to modernize the format with new features including interview clips, music news, and flashbacks, but the transition proved challenging as many stations defected when Kasem launched his competing show on Westwood One. ABC kept American Top 40 in its syndication lineup despite the continued lack of improvement in ratings, but in 1994 the network finally decided to cut its losses. The original AT40 ended on January 28, 1995.

### Ryan Seacrest (2004-Present)

Ryan Seacrest assumed hosting responsibilities on January 10, 2004, transforming AT40 with a contemporary approach and updated format. The show introduced a revolutionary chart system without recurrent rules, allowing songs to maintain chart positions far longer than traditional Billboard rankings. This change created impressive longevity milestones, culminating in Rema & Selena Gomez's "Calm Down" holding the all-time record at 75 consecutive weeks from November 2022 to April 2024.

Under Seacrest's leadership, AT40 embraced digital interactivity through online voting, social media integration, and mobile applications. The program incorporated listener "shoutouts" via toll-free numbers and expanded internationally through Twitter and Facebook engagement. These technological adaptations allowed global audiences to participate in the AT40 Extra segment and influence chart rankings through website voting.

American Top 40 also became more interactive, involving online song voting and e-mail, adapting to the digital age while maintaining its core countdown format.


### Chart Sources and Methodology Evolution

The show's chart sources have evolved significantly over its history, reflecting changes in how music popularity is measured:

### Pandemic Adaptation and Modern Resilience

The show demonstrated remarkable adaptability during the 2020 pandemic, with Seacrest broadcasting from home while featuring artist messages supporting healthcare workers. In March 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Seacrest started to host AT40 from his house; the show also included pre-recorded messages from artists thanking healthcare workers and encouraging listeners to stay home, practice social distancing, and to keep in touch with loved ones.

### Brand Evolution and Anniversary Celebrations

AT40 celebrated its 50th anniversary with a redesigned logo inspired by vinyl records. In August 2020, the show rebranded their logo for the 50th anniversary. It features lines similar to those on the edges of vinyl records. It was changed again in September 2021; the same month, Premiere Radio Networks secured Seacrest's continued hosting through 2025, ensuring the program's ongoing evolution in modern radio broadcasting.


### Statistical Legacy

### Cultural Impact and Industry Influence

American Top 40's impact extends far beyond simple chart reporting. The program has:

- Served as a cultural barometer, documenting changing musical tastes and social trends through its weekly countdowns

Casey Kasem started counting down the top 40 hits 50 years ago this weekend. The radio program "American Top 40" would become an enduring cultural document of the country's listening habits. This documentation aspect has made AT40 archives valuable resources for music historians and cultural researchers.

On the air for over 50 years, Casey founded the radio staple American Top 40, which continues to be the most relevant source for pop music hits. The program's influence extended beyond mere entertainment, as its rankings can affect an artist's popularity and sales, making it a significant force in the music industry.

The program's longevity speaks to its fundamental appeal: the simple human desire to know what music is most popular at any given moment. By combining this basic curiosity with storytelling, dedications, and celebrity, American Top 40 created a format that has proven remarkably durable across five decades of rapid technological and cultural change.

As it enters its sixth decade, American Top 40 remains a vital part of America's musical landscape, continuing Casey Kasem's original vision of keeping listeners' "feet on the ground and reaching for the stars." Today, American Top 40 continues to evolve while honoring its heritage, maintaining its position as America's definitive weekly music countdown and a testament to the enduring power of radio to connect artists with audiences and communities with shared musical experiences.
