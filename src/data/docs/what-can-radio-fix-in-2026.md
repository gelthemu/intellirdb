"Radio's growth in 2026 won't come from doing more, but from doing less while doing it better"

There are many radio options to try in the New Year to help you improve your revenue and ratings in 2026. Radio’s most competitive edge is understanding why someone is listening — not when. The audience hasn’t abandoned radio; they’ve abandoned homogenization, clutter and sameness. In my view, radio’s growth in 2026 won’t come from doing more, but from doing less while doing it better.

Today’s audience won’t "listen" for blocks of time. They move fluidly across all platforms, tuning in and out based on content, mood and need.

2026’s best performing stations will understand:

- Jettison ambiguity! Make it clear to your targeted audience who you are and what you stand for. What do you offer that other stations do not in your market? Why should the audience give you more listening time over anyone else?
- Radio’s most significant self-inflicted wound is creating noise.

Trying too hard to compete for attention in a very crowded media landscape causes mental fatigue, which actually exists. When the listener has too many choices, friction can be fatal.

Several ways to help accomplish improvements come from:

- Simplifying music clocks;
- Less commercial messages per break; and
- Tightening up your execution.

It’s critical to come across as having a human behind the mic, as this is now radio’s most valuable asset. AI-generated voices are becoming more common. Having a genuine, audience- and community-relating personality is crucial to station growth in 2026.

The industry has to stop laying off personnel NOW! You’re hurting yourself more than you realize. When you let go of air talent from the station and replace it with a jukebox, there’s no difference between you and the streaming services. What’s the reason for your audience to listen to you? You have no differentiator — nothing separating you from the noise. Good luck with that!

Successful growth in 2026 will allow:

- Air talent to have a warm and conversational style;
- The promotion of opinion and lived experiences (needed in storytelling); and
- The release of over-produced delivery.

_BTW: Listeners don’t connect with formats. They connect with people._

### Use Research Sparingly

Research is most often used to mitigate risk. The more astute approach is to use the data to address weaknesses while protecting strengths.

The goal is not to please everyone. Those days are long gone. The goal in 2026 is to be persuasive and unforgettable to a smaller, targeted audience rather than a sea of noise to a larger audience.

### Transform From Reach to Relationship

Reach is significant, but relationships matter more. Radio’s primary advantage over other media is the ability to be local, live and personable.

Strong audience growth in 2026 will be from stations that:

- Know audiences need to be treated as a community, not statistics.
- Ensure listeners feel included, valued and recognized.
- Understand high-cuming stations with low TSL are plentiful but lack engagement.

_Another vital statistic: Attention is rented._

### Loyalty Is Earned!

The average listener’s attention span is seven seconds! Your station must be part of that equation, or you’re out completely. It’s become an audio-jungle. Can you make sure you’re part of that combination, or are you just an afterthought?

Other important aspects to improve your station in 2026:

- Create Clarity and Energy: Ensure clear communication and a powerful energy to attract and retain listeners.
- Become Local and Personable: Radio’s best competing edge is its ability to be live and local. If you’re a small- or medium-market station, you need to be everywhere! Make sure your morning show broadcasts from different locations during the week. I’d be at the opening of an envelope. You need a local presence. Listeners must make your station top of mind and their first choice for listening enjoyment.
- Make Sure You’re Data-Driven: Sharp use of data will address weaknesses while protecting strengths.
- Engage With Your Community: Constructing relationships with your audience is much more important than reaching them.
- Groundbreaking Content: Consider original ideas that boost your online presence and participation.
