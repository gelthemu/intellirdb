[**American TOP 40**](/intellirdb?v=charts&sv=at40)

July 4th weekend 1970.


July 4th weekend 1970 — a new sound hit the airwaves from KDEO in El Cajon, California. Casey Kasem, a seasoned radio personality, kicked off the first-ever American Top 40 (AT40) broadcast, a show that would redefine how America listened to music.

Using Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for the week ending July 11, the show featured hits like Three Dog Night’s _“Mama Told Me (Not to Come)”_ at #1, The Jackson 5’s _“The Love You Save”_ at #2, and The Temptations’ _“Ball of Confusion”_ at #3.


These are the very first words and opening sentences spoken by radio host Casey Kasem with the maiden voyage of American Top 40:

> Here we go with the Top 40 hits of the nation this week on American Top 40, the best-selling and most-played songs from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Canada to Mexico. This is Casey Kasem in Hollywood, and in the next three hours we'll count down the 40 most popular hits in the United States this week, hot off the record charts of Billboard magazine for the week ending July 11, 1970.
>
> In this hour at No. 32 in the countdown, a song that's been a hit 4 different times in 19 years! And we're just one tune away from the singer with the $10,000 gold hubcaps on his car! Now, on with the countdown!

Kasem’s opening highlighted a song at #32, _“It’s All in the Game”_ by The Four Tops, noting its unique history as a hit four times in 19 years. He also teased a singer with $10,000 gold hubcaps on his car—Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere & the Raiders—whose song _“Silver Bird”_ was nearby at #33.

Other notable tracks included The Beatles’ _“The Long and Winding Road”_ at #8 and Elvis Presley’s _“The Wonder of You”_ at #9, marking the last time both icons appeared together in the top 10.
